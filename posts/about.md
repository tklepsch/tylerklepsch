# A little about me.
I’ve been in the web development sphere for over 5 years, primarily focusing on drupal and front-end development.

I’ve also had the chance to dabble in such areas as web design, accessibility testing and code revisions, project management, and development with frameworks such as Vue, Angular 2+ (with a bit of React on my own time).

These years of experience have improved not only my development skill set, but also my ability to plan, organize, build, present and deliver web applications to support business wants and needs.
