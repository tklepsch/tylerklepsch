I love walking. No, I’m not a dog (oh but what a simplier life that would be…), but it’s one of the activities I’ve come to fall in love with in the past year or so.

I make it a point, regardless of weather or lack of motivation, to do at least 30 minutes of walking a day.

It started out as a way to clear my head at work. I do a lot of problem solving in web development, so it causes a bit of a mental strain. I’d go out for walks in the afternoon to clear my head, think over a problem, or just take in the neighborhood I hadn’t ever explored before.

Eventually, a good friend of mine at work started joining me for said walks. I initially thought it might take away some of the benefits I mentioned earlier, but really, it just added to them.

We both had an avenue to vent some of our issues and frustrations, our experiences, or just not think about work at all and just joke around or talk about other things.

Thinking about it more, it makes sense. Humans are not stationary creatures. We love to move around, be productive, and explore. So naturally, walking is a good way to attain those wants. And I’m a lot happier for it.

It was the best thing I could have done for myself. And even in the age of Coronavirus, I still make it to go out for a walk once a day, now often with my roommate joining. Like two dogs holding the same stick.
