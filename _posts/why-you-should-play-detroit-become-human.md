I don’t replay many single player games. It’s even more rare that I’m willing to replay it multiple times. But a few months ago, I got around to playing Quantic Dream’s recent game Detroit Become Human.

The game is an adventure-style game set a future where Androids exist and are servants to humans. Suddenly, some androids start bypassing their programming and become sentient which creates a conflict between humans and their creations.

You play as three different androids (Connor, Markus, and Kara) and play out their stories. Each character is distinct in their paths.

You have Connor, the detective android sent by the corporation that created all androids to investigate the recent incidents of Androids bypassing their programming. Kara, an android who becomes sentient and is on the run after protecting a little girl from her abusive owner. And Markus, an android that becomes sentient and gets thrust into the forefront of the revolution.

Like past Quantic Dreams games Heavy Rain and Indigo Prophecy, you progress through many different paths for each story. These paths are determined by your dialogue chooses, performance at the quick time events, and how well you do in your investigation of the environments.

And it shows. I recall reading somewhere that there are 40+ possible variations to the main endings in the game. I can support this claim, because I played through the game a lot, trying to unlock as many possible variations to the story as I could before it became too redundant for me.

Even with that, there are still some unexplored variations I have yet to see.

I wont spoil too much what happened story wise, but my first play through was the most eye-opening of these possibilities. I decided to play my characters very specifically, rather than what I’d do in the situation. Unfortunately this meant one of my characters got killed off early on and I saw first hand the repercussions of that.

1/3 of the story was no longer there. And while I did learn that character’s story was less important to the overall plot, I missed some context for events going on outside the other two characters and key moments between each character. Also less play time over all, probably missing about 3-4 hours of extra cutscenes.

I also learned via the game’s global choice tracker that very few people went the route I did, at least on their first play through. That felt pretty unique.

And so, then I begun my replaying of the game. Trying to build out scenarios such as the best and worst possible endings, endings with specific characters, or just trying out scenarios where the population hates or loves you and how that affects your characters (it really really does).

I’d at least recommending playing through the game with a friend or watching someone play through the game. At the very least you get an entertaining movie out of it.

And if you’re into choose your own adventure style stories, I highly recommend you give this one a try.
