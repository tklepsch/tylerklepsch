Music can be a difficult thing to write about. It’s subjective on whether people will like a particular genre or not. Certain sounds just click with individuals and others don’t.

Today, I’m going to talk about one of this genres (sub-genres?) of music that wont appeal to everyone. It’s called Lo-fi.

Lo-fi stands for Low Fidelity music. According to Wikipedia, Lo-fi is a music or production quality in which elements usually regarded as imperfections of a recording or performance are audible, sometimes a deliberate aesthetic choice.

Basically it takes what one could associate as the low quality type of sounds you would get from old cassette tapes or record players and uses it to create music that I would describe as nostalgic and soothing.

I only learned about Lo-fi in the last couple of years. I can’t remember when exactly I started listening, but I recall one day when one of my friends was listening to a particularly chill playlist. It clicked with me right away.

That particular playlist was from a YouTube channel called [ChilledCow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJ4gkVC6NrvII8umztf0O) and the playlist was [lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A). If you’re an avid youtuber, you might have seen that image of the anime girl studying before. Well, now you know the context!

And so every now and then I’ll put on this and other playlists whenever I’m writing, working on developer stuff, or just need some chill background music when I have friends over.

It’s just relaxing and puts me in the right mood to focus or cool down. And perhaps it will do the same for you.

One other thing I like about lofi is how creative the online community is with it. There are a ton of remixes and playlists out there, many which are free to listen to. One such remixes that my video game loving self appreciates is this one I discovered recently for the dk rap from Donkey Kong 64:

I don’t really have too much else to say about Lo-fi. It’s nice and maybe someone will read this down the line and come to appreciate it too.

Below I’ll link to some playlists and songs if you’re interested in listening. Some of the playlists may be mixed in with other similarly sounding music, but they tend to work pretty well together.
