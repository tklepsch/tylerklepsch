After I'm done work, I'm like a slug. Most I feel like doing is cooking and going for a walk. Occasionally I get a bout of motivation to do stuff, but that doesn't account for the majority of cases.

This is where something like the 10-minute rule might come in handy.

The 10 minute rule is an exercise in productivity. The idea behind it is to limit the tasks you plan to do to 10 minute intervals. You set a timer for 10 minutes, and then get to work! Once the timer goes off, you stop.

There are multiple interpretations of how you can approach this. One example is to reduce your to-do list for the day to more specific tasks.

So, if you were to clean your house, then you would say limit each room to 10 minutes of cleaning before you moved onto the next room. Maybe you'll finish, maybe you wont. If you don't get a room clean enough, next time you say clean half the room in 10 minutes instead.

Another example I've found is in this video by a youtuber called the [WheezyWaiter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQL5ABUvwY7YoW5lgMyAS_w).

[![Wheezy Waiter video about how to stop procrastinating with the 10 minute rule](https://img.youtube.com/vi/5bVMkduWDGY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bVMkduWDGY)

In the video, his approach to the 10 minute rule is to have a general to-do task spread out through multiple days. And he was able to get the following done within 7 days:
- Came up with an outline for a book.
- Wrote a song
- Cleaned his garage.

Not bad. So, I tried that method with this blog post and was able to write it in 3 days...despite not posting it until one month later. Oops. But hey! I didn't have to add much to this. So...Mission Accomplished?

Obviously this wont work with everything. But adopting this 10-minute rule for a small things like cleaning, planning your week, or even to learn a new skill might go a long way.

Who knows, maybe I'll use this method to actually develop this site more and write more blog posts.
